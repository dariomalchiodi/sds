# Acknowledgements

Several people read and commented on what I wrote, contributing in a
fundamental way to the final result: Alessandro Di Giorgi helped me refine the
mathematical exposition in certain sections. Nicola Ludwig enriched one of my
excursions into the world of physics. Marco De Petri, Matteo Princisgh, and
Nicolò Rosati carefully read the drafts and found many imperfections, which I
hope I have corrected. I thank all of them for devoting some of their time and
energy to this work, stressing that any remaining mistakes or inaccuracies are
entirely my responsibility.

I feel I must also thank Laura Ripamonti, who many years ago spaked the idea to
me of using superheroes as a teaching example, Serena Paolo and Paolo Boldi,
who—for very different (though not so different) reasons—first become aware of
my plan to write a book and who encouraged me to pursue it, for very similar
(though not so similar) reasons. To all of these people, and to those I may be
unintentionally forgetting, I want to express my gratitude for the support they
gave me.
