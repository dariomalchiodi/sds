# Learning <span class="ast">\*</span>and<span class="ast">\*</span> programming

As described in the previous section, I will introduce concepts alongside
(or sometimes before) examples. Where possible, I will also show
_implementations_ using a relatively modern programming language:
specifically, I’ll refer to [Python](https://www.python.org) and its
_data science stack_, which consists of packages widely used&mdash;at the time
of writing&mdash;by the open source community involved on data
analysis[^libraries]. A basic competence in computer programming is therefore
highly recommended.
```{margin}
This book is an evolution of a set of lecture notes designed for second-year
students in undergraduate Computer Science programs, so I’ll be assuming the
level of programming knowledge typically gained in the first year of such
programs&mdash;or in similar degrees.
```

{ref}`chap:introducing-python` provides a mid-to-advanced level overview
of the Python features that are used throughout the book, and can help readers
already familiar with programming but new to this language get up to speed.
Reading this chapter is recommended for everyone, in order to get familiar
with the conventions I use when writing code.

This book is written using a technology that allows some content to be
generated by running Python code. The code is shown explicitly whenever the
reader is being guided through the implementation of one or more concepts.
Conversely, when code is used to produce elements such as tables or plots, it
is hidden by default. In those cases, a «Show code» link lets thre reader
toggle the visibility of the hidden code. I encourage everyone to take
advantage of this opportunity: just as passively reading a text is of little
benefit, mindlessly running code makes little sense; instead, it's important to
analyze it, understand it, and modify it (even changes made just to better
grasp how it works are worthwile). In short, _play with it_ in the
true _hacker_ spirit&mdash; understood in the original sense of the
word[^hacker]. In fact, the book can be explored even without a full
understanding of the code or the need to run it: as shown in
{ref}`sec:overview`, certain sections include interactive elements
specifically designed to support a clearer grasp of the underlying concepts.
```{margin}
The interactive parts rely on [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/), a technology
that runs Python conde in modern web browsers. It does not require any manual
installation or configuration, although it requires an active Internet
connection and a supported web browser (any up-to-date WebAssembly-enabled
browser, notably Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Chromium-based browsers).
```

I often try to guide the reader through the actual implementation of
fundamental tools&mdash;particularly in the first part of the book, which
focuses on descriptive statistics. These implementations should not be seen as
substitutes for professional libraries: their purpose is to highlight essential
aspects that help in understanding one or more core concepts. The idea is that
by simulating a tool or technique through code, its inner workings become
clearer. These implementations are not intended for production use&mdash;much
like how developers have once learned to implement sorting algorithms from
scratch to grasp their logic, even though in their daily work they ultimately
rely on optimized, well-tested versions provided by standard libraries. With
this in mind, each “DIY” approach is followed by a reference to the
corresponding functionality in state-of-the-art Python packages.

In principle, this book can be read even without prior programming experience
by simply skipping sections that include, describe, or discuss code. However,
this comes with the real risk of missing key insights, as much of the content
is built around the interplay between explanations and code. For those less
familiar with programming, it may be worthwhile to first consult books adopting
a more traditional approach, such as:

- Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences, by Sheldon Ross
  {cite:p}`ross`,
- Introduction to Statistics, by Marylin K. Pelosi, Theresa M. Sandifer,
  Paola Cerchiello and Paolo Giudici {cite:p}`pelosi`.

A word of caution for those whithout programming experience who might be
tempted to read this book to learn coding&mdash;perhaps alongside learning data
analysis. This is __not__ a book for learning to program from scratch, but
rather a book for learning _through_ programming, where code serves as a tool
to deepen understanding of another subject. There’s a saying that you haven’t
truly understood something unless you can explain it to your
grandmother[^cite-granny]: I take this to heart and extend it by  that a
technical concept isn't fully grasped until you can implement it by writing a
program. However, to follow this approach, a basic ability to write software is
required&mdash; a skill that demands time, effort, and dedicated learning
resources. For those starting out, there are many excellent books available,
such as:

- [Think Python](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/), by Allen B.
  Downey {cite:p}`downey`.
- C Programming: A Modern Approach, by Kim N. King {cite:p}`king`,
- Programming in Go, by Ivo Balbaert {cite:p}`balbaert`.

I intentionally selected three relatively recent books, each centered on a
different programming language. The aim is to understand the fundamentals of
programming, rather than the finer details of any one language.

[^libraries]: The repository associated with this book includes a
[file](https://github.com/dariomalchiodi/sds/blob/main/requirements.in) that
lists all the libraries used to generate the contents, including those
required to run the code.
[^hacker]: The term _hacker_ is commonly used today with a negative
connotation, essentially equating it with someone who pursues malicious aims
by writing or modifying software, or more generally exploiting security
vulnerabilities to misuse digital technologies. However, the modern English use
of the term dates back to around 1960 and originally carried a more neutral
meaning, not directly tied to computing: it referred to someone with the talent
to deeply understand how a system works, and thus able to control it to
the extent of using it in ways different from its original design purposes. To
give a historical&mdash;though illegal&mdash;example: one of the earliest
famous _hacks_ involved using the «Cap’n Crunch Bo’sun Whistle» (a toy included
in boxes of a popular cereal brand, shown in {numref}`fig-whistle`) to make
free long-distance or international calls from certain public telephones in the
United States. One of the places where the hacker counterculture began to take
shape was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT): the earliest known
written reference of the term «hacking» appears in the minutes of a 1955
meeting of the [Tech Model Railroad Club](http://tmrc.mit.edu/), a student club
of model train enthusiasts. It was only later that the term become closely
linked with the world of computing.

[^cite-granny]: The true origin of this saying is hard to pinpoint: some
attribute it to Einstein, others to Feynman or Rutherford&mdash;there seems to
be consensus, at least, that it comes from the world of physics. Variants also
exist in which the grandmother is replaced by a child, or, for some reasons,
even by a bartender.
