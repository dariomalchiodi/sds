# Learning <span class="ast">\*</span>and<span class="ast">\*</span> programming

As described in the previous section, I will introduce concepts alongside
(or sometimes before) examples. Where possible, I will also show
_implementations_ using a relatively modern programming language:
specifically, I’ll refer to [Python](https://www.python.org) and its
_data science stack_, which consists of packages widely used&mdash;at the time
of writing&mdash;by the open source community involved on data
analysis[^libraries]. A basic competence in computer programming is therefore
highly recommended.
```{margin}
This book is an evolution of a set of lecture notes designed for second-year
students in undergraduate Computer Science programs, so I’ll be assuming the
level of programming knowledge typically gained in the first year of such
programs&mdash;or in similar degrees.
```

Chapter {numref}`#introducing-python` provides a mid-to-advanced level overview
of the Python features that are used throughout the book, and can help readers
already familiar with programming but new to this language get up to speed.
Reading this chapter is recommended for everyone, in order to get familiar
with the conventions I use when writing code.

This book is written using a technology that allows some content to be
generated by running Python code. The code is shown explicitly whenever the
reader is being guided through the implementation of one or more concepts.
Conversely, when code is used to produce elements such as tables or plots, it
is hidden by default. In those cases, a «Show code» link lets thre reader
toggle the visibility of the hidden code. I encourage everyone to take
advantage of this opportunity&mdash;not by passively reading the text or
blindly running the code, but by analyzing it, understanding it, and modifying
it (even just to better grasp how it works!). In short, _play with it_ in the
true _hacker_ spirit&mdash; understood in the original sense of the
word[^hacker]. Actually, you can even play with the book without necessarily
understanding or running the code: as shown in [A quick overview](uno-sguardo-di-insieme), some content is
interactive, and manipulating it is designed to help you grasp the concepts
more easily.
```{margin}
The book was generated using [MyST](https://mystmd.org/), which includes a
variant of the <wiki:Markdown> format as well as the software used to convert
it into the HTML pages you’re reading.

The interactive parts rely on technologies (especially
[JupyterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite)) that are still in an
early development phase, but have the big advantage of not requiring any manual
installation. That said, patience may be required, and it’s important to use a
supported web browser.
```

Very often I try to guide the reader through the actual implementation of
fundamental tools—especially in the first part, which focuses on descriptive
statistics. The final results should not be considered at the level of
professional libraries: the aim here is to focus on essential aspects that
support learning one or more concepts. Moreover, these implementations are not
intended for production use: just like it makes sense for a developer to learn
how to implement sorting algorithms from scratch (and to be able to do so if
needed), but then rely on the well-optimized and thoroughly tested
implementations provided by libraries. With this in mind, immediately after
each “DIY” implementation, readers are pointed toward the use of
state-of-the-art libraries.

In principle, even readers with no programming experience can read this book by
skipping the parts that include, describe, or discuss code. But this comes with
the real risk of not fully grasping the content, given that much of the book
alternates between text and code. For these readers, I recommend considering
more traditional texts, such as:

- Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences, by Sheldon Ross
  {cite:p}`ross`,
- Introduction to Statistics, by Marylin K. Pelosi, Theresa M. Sandifer,
  Paola Cerchiello and Paolo Giudici {cite:p}`pelosi`.

A word of caution, too, for those who can’t program but are tempted to read
this book to learn how—perhaps while also learning data analysis. This is
__not__ a book for learning to program, but rather a book for learning _by_
programming, where code is used as a tool to enhance the learning of another
subject. There’s a saying that you haven’t really understood something unless
you can explain it to your grandmother[^cite-granny]: I take that to heart and
stretch it a bit by saying you haven’t truly understood a technical concept
until you can implement it by writing a program. But if you want to follow this
philosophy, you need to have already learned how to write _software_, which is
a skill that takes time, energy, and dedicated resources to acquire.
Also in this case, there are many good books that can help, for instance:

- [Think Python](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkPythonItalian/blob/master/thinkpython_italian.pdf), by Allen B. Downey {cite:p}`downey`.
- C Programming: A Modern Approach, by Kim N. King {cite:p}`king`,
- Programming in Go, by Ivo Balbaert {cite:p}`balbaert`.

I’ve intentionally listed three fairly recent books, each focused on a
different language: the goal here is to learn programming basics, not the
intricacies of a specific language. Lastly, this section only references books
written in Italian, but it’s always worth considering the original version of a
book if it’s in English, or looking for English versions designed for
non-native speakers.

[^librerie]: The repository associated with this book contains a
[file](https://github.com/dariomalchiodi/sds/blob/main/requirements.in)
listing all the libraries used to generate the content, including those needed to run the code.

[^hacker]: The term _hacker_ is nowadays commonly used with a negative connotation,
essentially equating it with someone who pursues malicious goals by writing or modifying
_software_, or more generally exploiting security flaws to misuse existing digital technologies.
In reality, the modern English use of the term dates back to around 1960, but originally
carried a more neutral meaning, not directly linked to computing:
it described someone with the talent to deeply understand how a system works,
and therefore able to control it to the point of using it in ways that differ
from the purposes for which the system was originally designed.
Just to give a well-known—though illegal—example: one of the earliest famous _hacks_
involved using the “Cap’n Crunch Bo’sun Whistle” (a whistle included as a toy
in boxes of a popular cereal brand, shown in @fig-whistle) to make free
long-distance or international calls from certain public telephones in the United States.
One of the places where hacker counterculture started to emerge was the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT): the first written mention of
“hacking” refers to the minutes of a 1955 meeting of the
[Tech Model Railroad Club](http://tmrc.mit.edu/), a student club of model train enthusiasts.
Only more recently has the term become closely associated with the world of computing.

[^cite-granny]: It's hard to trace the true origin of this saying:
some attribute it to Einstein, others to Feynman, and others to Rutherford
(apparently there's consensus on it coming from the world of physics);
there are also variants where the grandmother is replaced by a child—or,
for some reason—even by a bartender.
