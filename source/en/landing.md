# Superhero Data Science  
## Data analysis, probability theory, and statistics

### Disclaimer

This book is a work in progress, currently in a preliminary stage.
Therefore, I do not recommend using the information presented here as the
primary basis for studying data analysis techniques, probability theory, or
statistics.

From a technical standpoint, the material is generated using
[MyST](https://mystmd.org/), a technology under development within the
[Executable Books](https://github.com/executablebooks) project, which at the
moment (as far as I can tell from studying the documentation) does not
adequately support some important aspects of book writing. In particular:
  
- Automatic numbering of some elements is only activated within individual
  pages, which causes counters to reset when moving from one page to another.
- The issues mentioned above also affect cross-references, with the additional
  problem that references to entire chapters are not handled.
- Finally, it is not possible to introduce customizations in the CSS style used
  to generate the web pages. This prevents choosing a specific font for the
  text and customizing the placement of certain elementsâ€”for example, margin
  notes are not vertically aligned with the paragraph they refer to.

In some cases, I have found workarounds, which often do not fully resolve the
issues and are based on not particularly elegant shortcuts. I trust that a
future version of MyST will address these issues, as the community developing
it is very active. I would be grateful to anyone who, knowing this technology
better than I do, can help me improve the current version of the book. For this
purpose, please follow the guidelines provided in the dedicated section of the
[repository](https://github.com/dariomalchiodi/sds/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
associated with the book.
