# Superhero Data Science
## Data Analysis, Probability Calculations, and Statistics

### Disclaimer

This book is a work in progress, currently in a preliminary phase. The contents
are generated using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for web
page generation, [MyST](https://mystmd.org/) (a technology under development
within the [Executable Books](https://github.com/executablebooks) project) to
describe the content, and custom software I developed specifically to implement
some important aspects related to writing a book, such as customizing
cross-references, automatic code execution, or interactive components, which
are not adequately supported by the aforementioned technologies.

I do not recommend using the information presented here as the primary basis
for studying data analysis techniques, probability theory, or statistics. The
current status of the content is summarized in the following list.
